## Data Structure Implementation

The academic calendar is implemented using the following database models:

- **AcademicYear**: Defines the overall year
- **Term**: Subdivides the year into teaching periods (terms/semesters)
- **Holiday**: Defines breaks and non-teaching days
- **CalendarItem**: Specific events, exams, and milestones (now linked to terms)

### Key Relationships

- **CalendarItem** â†” **Term**: Calendar items can be linked to specific terms/semesters for better organization
- **Term** belongs to **AcademicYear**
- **AcademicCalendar** contains **CalendarItem**s

## API Endpoints

Existing endpoints for managing the calendar:

- `GET /api/academic-calendar/terms` - Retrieve terms
- `POST /api/academic-calendar/terms` - Create term
- `GET /api/academic-calendar/holidays` - Retrieve holidays
- `POST /api/academic-calendar/holidays` - Create holiday
- `POST /api/academic-calendar/calendar-items` - Create calendar item (now supports termId)
- `GET /api/academic-calendar/calendar/:academicCalendarId/items` - Get calendar items (includes term info)
- `GET /api/academic-calendar/calendar` - Get full calendar view (includes calendar items)

## Population Strategy

To populate the calendar for 2024/25:

1. Create AcademicYear record
2. Create Term records for each term
3. Create Holiday records for breaks and public holidays
4. Create CalendarItem records for exams, events, and milestones
5. Use bulk operations where possible for efficiency

## Enhancements Needed

- Bulk create endpoints for calendar items
- Calendar export functionality (PDF/ICS)
- Recurring event support
- Calendar sharing and subscription features
